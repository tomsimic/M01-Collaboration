Program: appointment.py

This program is to be used as a module for the final project application for
team project assignment.

NOTE:I changed it a bit so you guys can easier extrapolate what arguments
need to be added. Once we are ready to implement this, we can remove all
the variables starting with 'business_' since those will be suplimented
by the GUI module through business selection. I'll refactor it a bit more
once we have general GUI interaction sorted out.
